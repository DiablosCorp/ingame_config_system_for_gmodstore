This system should be added to your addons if you want to get it working. Gmodstore system will grant you a panel to configure all the gmodstore addons which integrated their addon on it (including this one).


Manual configuration (by going on a config.lua script) is still possible if you don't want to use it.

This system is **not affiliated with gmodstore** and has been made by [Diablos](https://www.gmodstore.com/users/diablos).
If you have any question or you need a further assistance, please don't contact him directly and open a GitHub issue - but before that, please read the "_Server owner_" part of the Wiki tab.
